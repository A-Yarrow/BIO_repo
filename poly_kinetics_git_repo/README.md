This is an ipython notebook for polymerase single extension kinetics collected 
from QuantStudio3. Input data is in multi-component data consisting of flourescence
for ROX and SYBR-Green. The data is normalized to ROX. Data is plotted 
for different concentrations of polymerase and initial rates are calculated for each
sample. Data is also plotted as a box plot to compare relative activity.
